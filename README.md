### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!

<br/>
<br/>

My name is Ifat
- 👩‍💻 I work as a Software Development Engineer at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)'s Payment Security, and am a part of multiple teams that make sure your details are secured throughout the payment process!
- ☕ I'm tech-blogging at [CupofCode](https://cupofcode.blog/) with the passion to make technical knowledge more accecible and less scary (*“If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.”― Albert Einstein* 😉).
- 👩‍👧‍👧 I volunteer at [AliceCode](https://www.alicecode.org/en) and teach girls ages 12-14 programming, exposing them to the wonderous world of software development, and to useful abilities that are way beyond code!

  I have created the 3rd year curriculum, teaching the girls how to work together with Git and how to create server-client websites using REST API!
