### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!

You've probably arrived here to learn more about me and my abilities, but you'll mostly find old University excersises I submitted when I was a student 😅

So let me introduce myself!
- 👩‍💻 I work as a Software Development Engineer at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)'s Payment Security, and am a part of multiple teams that make sure your details are secured safely throughout the payment process!
- ☕ I'm tech-blogging at [CupofCode](https://cupofcode.blog/) with the passion to make technical knowledge more accecible and less scary (*“If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.”― Albert Einstein* 😉).
- 👩‍👧‍👧 I volunteer at [AliceCode](https://www.alicecode.org/en) and teach girls ages 12-14 programming, exposing them to the wonderous world of software development, and to useful abilities that are way beyond code! 

Where should you go next? Depands what interests you!
- 💻 If you want to go the technical route, you read about [basic commands on Git](https://cupofcode.blog/intro-to-git/), or maybe [learn about AWS](https://cupofcode.blog/cloud-computing-and-aws/).
- ✍️ If you want to visit my blog, here are my top most popular posts (heads up, you'll quickly notice a pattern of naive false promises of part 2s 😅):
